### Jasmin Peephole Visual Compiler ###


## Description ##
----------------

This compiler was created to generate code for the peephole pattern portion of McGill's compilers
course ([COMP 520](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~cs520/)). It takes as input a language defined
specifically for this compiler (explained more in
[`grammar/README`](https://github.com/vbonnet/Peephole-Compiler/blob/master/grammar/README.md)).
The language is designed to resemble the [Jasmin](http://jasmin.sourceforge.net/) bytecode while
still allow for the creation of complex patterns.  The output of the compiler is .h files that
depend on the [optimize.c](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~cs520/2012/joos/a-/optimize.c) API.  To see how
each statement and expression is transformed into c, or for an example output, see the
[`output`](https://github.com/vbonnet/Peephole-Compiler/blob/master/output.md)) file


## Dependencies ##
------------------

This project uses [ANTLR](http://antlr.org/) for its parser generator.  ANTLR provides many target
languages, this project is using the [Ruby target](http://antlr.ohboyohboyohboy.org/) for ANTLR.
The docs for the code generated by this target can be found at
http://rubydoc.info/github/ohboyohboyohboy/antlr3/.  Unfortunately the docs themselves are somewhat
lacking as the main developer seems to have dropped the project.  Honestly given the support
provided for ANTLR+Ruby we probably should've picked a different language.  But @vbonnet wanted to
code in Ruby, so that was that.


## Installation ##
------------------

The first step in installation is to install the actual repo.

    git clone git://github.com/vbonnet/Peephole-Compiler.git

The repo comes with the ANTLR code inside the `lib/` directory.  However the Ruby target requires
some ruby code not included with the project.  To download this code simply run

    gem install antlr3

Now you're set to go!  To generate the Lexer+Parser simply run: (There will be a Makefile later, I'm
just lazy)

     ./gen_grammar

That should generate `PeepholeLexer.rb` and `PeepholeParser.rb` inside `src/grammar/`.


## Running the code ##
----------------------

You can run the code by simply running the command:

    ./peephole tests/sample.pattern

This currently prints to stdout (I recommend `[_command] > tests/math.h; emacs tests/math.h`) for
now.  It'll soon be printing to a file, just you wait.  This should generate valid c code (built
around optimize.c) for the file parsed.  The way to use the output is still bad atm, firstly you
have to move
[`peephole_helpers.h`](https://github.com/vbonnet/Peephole-Compiler/blob/master/peephole_helpers.h)
into your JOOS directory.  Then you add the following to your `patterns.h` file:

    #include "[generated_file].gen.h"

Finally you have to rename `init_patterns()` in the generated file and then call it.  This part is
particularly ugly and will be fixed soon.


## Style guides ##
------------------

* The Ruby code should follow the [Github Ruby styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby)
* The grammar has its own style, defined in
[`grammar/README`](https://github.com/vbonnet/Peephole-Compiler/blob/master/grammar/README.md)
* keep all lines within 100 columns (if possible)

## Contributing ##
------------------

Go for it!  Submit a pull request, feel free.  We're working on our own stuff atm, so feel free to
write up feature requests but know they may not be addressed in what you may consider reasonable
time.  Honestly you're better off just adding whatever you want yourself.  Bugs we will likely
address in reasonable time seeing as we're using this ourselves.


## Some Thoughts ##
-------------------

* The output isn't very user friendly yet, sorry about that.  This project is in the works, and
though we'd love for it to be as clean as possible, getting it working is a priority at this point.
* You can break the code, that's not really our main concern at this point.  If you want to confuse
the compiler with complex brain-bending input, feel free.  Nobody's going to die if the program
fails to compile something, so it's all cool.
* The compiler isn't nice about telling you what's failing in the input.  I know that and would like
to fix it eventually.  But for now, just use the compiler for those inputs that are convenient.  And
for the rest, please tell us about them, or even better find the way to do it and send it by.
