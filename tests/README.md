# WARNING #
-----------

This code was all written for COMP 520, so please do not commit fancy patterns here.  This does
put us in an unfortunate position as to testing, because we'd like to add corner cases, but don't
want to add a large number of peephole patterns that future years can just use instead of doing the
assignment.  It should be possible to generate a rubbish pattern that deals with the case you care
about though, please consider obfuscating your pattern in this way before adding it here.

To make testing easier we've created the  `hidden/` directory.  This directory is ignored in the
.gitignore, so feel free to add your tests in there.  That way there is a convenient location to
place tests that will not get uploaded to this repository.
